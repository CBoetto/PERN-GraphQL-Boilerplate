Hello, this is a simple PERN + GraphQL / Apollo boilerplate that I set up to be a base point for further projects.

It includes a functioning user authentication system that works with JWT + HTTPOnly cookies.

I will be altering this as time goes on to include some simple starting unit tests and more.

If you are just learning GraphQL/Apollo and want to integrate it with the PERN stack, I will be writing a few blog articles about the basic setup
